Mousse means foam in French.
A mousse is a soft prepared food that incorporates air bubbles to give it a light and airy texture. It can range from light and fluffy to creamy and thick, depending on preparation techniques. A mousse may be sweet or savory.
 Itâ€™s very rich thanks to the cream and chocolate.
 This gives it an intense chocolate flavor and the perfect texture.
